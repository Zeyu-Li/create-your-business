Create Your Business (For Canadians)
========================================

This is a doc for those who want to start a business in Canada and have a guidance on where to start and tips and tricks

About
%%%%%%%
Businesses as an entity have been the cornerstone of economy. Creating a business comes with many challenges but will be rewarding if successful (big if here). 
With that being said and you still want to peruse it, read on and good luck!

ðŸš§ **Warning**: 20% of businesses within the first year, 30% by year 2 and 50% by the five year mark according to sources

Types of businesses
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are 3 main types of businesses, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. I will give a very short run down of these three types

1. **sole proprietorship** - great for just starting out with one person but should only be used for very small operations
2. **partnership** - same as sole proprietorships but with a partner instead
3. **corporation** - a legal entity that is distinct from the owner. This means legal and financial consequences (ie debt) will not directly impact the owner(s) of the company [this is what makes corporations fundamentally different from the previous two]

For this doc we will mainly focus on **corporations** but some sections still apply to the others (like taxes)


Starting a business
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The first step to start a business. This does not have to be official but you need to think of a general idea of the business. This should be a precise goal and should be reflected in a 1 sentence statement most people refer to as the **mission statement**

âœ¨ **Tip**: if you want to be extra prepared, write a doc with market analysis, target market, timeline, cost analysis, etc. Most people refer to this as the business plan. See below for an example of a plan's overview:

Create a business
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The first step to legally creating a business is to register it with the government. 

Taxes
%%%%%%%
Taxes are one of the highest expenses for businesses. However businesses can take advantage of many tax write offs since ``revenue - expenses = profit``

See the `CRA website
<https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-expenses.html>`_ for a full list of tax deductible expenses
